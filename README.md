# Senior Mobile App Developer

I help business take advantages through a mobile application which is created with the use of modern technologies. Not only compliance with up-to-date Google design standard is on principal, but also bringing passion to perfect UI and UX into every project.

I am prepared to share invaluable experience in all areas related to Android from 'Analytics' to 'supporting all Android versions' and give deep expertise in nuances as well as ready to work with Scrum or any other Agile development methodology. I strongly believe that when done right, a modern and well mannered mobile application can provide your customers with a great way to access your product and services.

However, creating and maintaining a modern mobile application can be a risky venture. There are procedural risks, technical and other hacks in hiring a credible person. That's where I come in, I stand out in creating mobile applications for startups and established companies using the cutting edge technologies and engineering models. I will strive to provide an outstanding application that will be free from all odds and also minimize the factors that break your budget.

I am highly qualified and credible in Requirement Analysis, Design Thinking Concepts and implementing applications using latest technologies like Android (Native) Java, Kotlin, React Native, Flutter, .

I always forward to building a long term professional relationship of mutual trust and benefit with clients.
